# clj-autograd

These are some experiments to bring a pytorch like autograd to Clojure. This is
not primarily a neural network library, but rather a means of abstraction to
calculate gradients for scientific computing. `clj-autograd` uses neanderthal at
the moment, because we want to be as fast as possible.


## Usage

Look at the tests for now.

## TODO

- polymorphic product for scalar, vector, matrix, tensor
- identity of Variable? yes, as atom for inplace ops
- trace shapes
- 1. demo
  linear regression DONE
  gradient check DONE
- basic operations to classify MNIST:
- loss: sub, pow DONE
- forward with (mini)batches:
  + mmul
- activations:
- sigmoid DONE
- requires_grad DONE
- optimizer DONE
- lazyness?
- figure out how to do in-place ops?
